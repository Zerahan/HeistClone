✓	Make checklist

✓	Interact with object with the E key.
✓	Interactions always take time where the key is held down.
✓	Movement is disabled while interacting with an object.
✓	The object being interacted with is detected once when the interact key is pressed - the player can still look around while the key is held.
	When looting, limit camera rotation to 45 degrees off the original angle?
✓	While interacting with an object, a progress bar is put onto the UI to show when the interaction will be finished.
	
✓	The player can sprint
	Sprint is limited
✓	The player can crouch.
	
✓	Interact (e) with loot object to "bag" it. This takes 2 seconds.
✓	Only one bag can be carried
✓	Carried bags show their type on the UI.
✓	When carrying a bag, the camera is tilted 15 degrees to the left. EDIT: 5 degrees
✓	Bag can be thrown (g key)
✓	Loot comes in types (jewelry, gold, money)
✓	Loot type determines value.
✓	Bags containing loot thrown into "stash zone" are deleted and added to score 1 second after colliding with it.
✓	Once enough loot bags have been dropped into the van, the escape zone at the van becomes available.
✓	Entering an active escape zone ends the level and finalizes your score. Any carried bags are automatically added to score.
✓	Bags can contain non-loot. Non-loot bags don't get deleted by the stash zone.
	Non-loot bags dropped into the "trash" zone are destroyed 1 second after collision.

✓	Cameras detect the player
✓	Cameras take 10 seconds to become "alerted".
✓	Entities that can detect the player add a hud indicator that points back to them and shows their status.
✓	Once alerted, the camera "calls" security. This takes 5 seconds, and sets off the alarm when it's finished.
✓	Camera alert level cools down at the same rate that it heats up.
✓	Once alarm is goes off, you have 1 minute to get to the van.
✓	After the 1 minute is up, you automatically lose.
✓	Cameras can be in a "loop" state, where they can't detect the player. This state lasts 20 seconds.
✓	Cameras can be interacted with to set them to the "loop" state. This interaction takes 2 seconds.
✓	Cameras can have an "operator". If the operator is killed, the cameras are disabled.

	Losing sets your score to zero.
